## Legislative Workflow

#### Background
This application manages bills in a legislative body. Typically a bill goes through a few stages:
   * Proposal
   * Committee debate
   * Committee vote
   * Floor debate
   * Floor vote
   * Executive sign-off

The bill can be cancelled at any stage. However, there are a few alternatives:
   * Resolutions don't get executive sign-off
   * Appropriations bills must pass a second vote by an ancillary committee

#### Problem
Bill, Appropriation, Resolution are all classes, but there seems to be duplicated functionality. How can you clean up the duplicated code?
