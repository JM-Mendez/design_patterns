# Lab: Singleton Logger

## Summary: 

Confused and inebriated interns wrote some code. To their credit,
they anticipate and handle common error conditions, but
instantiating a logger class incurs performance penalties. Also,
newing up the class ties. 
                  
## Requirements
1. Implement a singleton logger
2. Make the logger thread-safe

## Stretch Goals
* Make the dependency explicit
